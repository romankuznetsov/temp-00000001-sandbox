# Exercises /lib/netifd/proto/qwdtt.sh away from a router. The handler decides
# what the client is started with and which configurations are refused, and
# every way it can be wrong is quiet: a tunnel that carries nothing, or a
# default route into the tunnel that swallows the client's own traffic to VK
# and takes the router's WAN with it. So the checks it makes are asserted here
# against stubs for the netifd and uci helpers, with the command line printed
# instead of started.
